            The player takes on the role of a project manager and receives 1
            random contributor from each IT sector. Each participant will have 3
            proposals, only 1 of which is “green”. Some proposals are
            eco-responsible (green) where others are only superficially (red).
            At any time, one or other of the speakers can spread false
            information to achieve his or her ends. Every decision taken by the
            person in charge of projects has an impact on the general mood of
            the company, filling the interface with rust and raising a
            thermostat if the carbon footprint explodes.
